Google Tag Manager plugin for the Brightcove Player

This plugin was adapted from the [Google Tag Manager plugin for the Brightcove Player](https://github.com/iabramo/brightcove-gtm)

Main changes from the original:
- Using 'videojs-ga-videocloud - v0.4.2 - 2016-08-24' as the the base version from from the [Google Analytics plugin for Brightcove Player](https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/videojs-ga-videocloud)
- Sends events and information to the data layer instead of events directly to GA, for window.ga condition also.

This is created for testing and not ready for production use.
